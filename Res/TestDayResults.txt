Test day 1:

Goal: Simple test day. See what subtle changes are noticeable to a person in virtual reality
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 1:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 2:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 3:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 4:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 5:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 6:
Niels:2
Didi:0

Test 7:
Niels:2
Didi:1

Test 8:
Niels:2
Didi:1

Test 9:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 10:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 11:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Conclusions: The slight manipulation of movement were only barely noticeable for users knowing what to look for. In the next test setup we will do more extreme tests.

Test day 2:

Goal: Continuation of test days 
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 12:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 13:
Niels:3.5
Didi:2

Test 14:
Niels:3.5
Didi:2

Test 15:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 16:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 17:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 18:
Niels:5
Didi:3

Test 19:
Niels:5
Didi:3

Test 20:
Niels:6
Didi:3.5

Test 21:
Niels:6.5
Didi:3.5

Test 22:
Niels:6.5
Didi:3.5

Conclusions: I would say test 14 is the maximum manipulation acceptable.
That means that an angle change of 1.4 degrees per meter is barely noticeable.
This also means that this method has too little effect to properly use.
