Test day 1:

Goal: Simple test day. See what subtle changes are noticeable to a person in virtual reality
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 1:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 2:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 3:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 4:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 5:
Niels:0
Didi:0

Test 6:
Niels:2
Didi:0

Test 7:
Niels:2
Didi:1

Test 8:
Niels:2
Didi:1

Test 9:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 10:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 11:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Conclusions: The slight manipulation of movement were only barely noticeable for users knowing what to look for. In the next test setup we will do more extreme tests.

Test day 2:

Goal: Continuation of test days 
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 12:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 13:
Niels:3.5
Didi:2

Test 14:
Niels:3.5
Didi:2

Test 15:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 16:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 17:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 18:
Niels:5
Didi:3

Test 19:
Niels:5
Didi:3

Test 20:
Niels:6
Didi:3.5

Test 21:
Niels:6.5
Didi:3.5

Test 22:
Niels:6.5
Didi:3.5

Conclusions: I would say test 14 is the maximum manipulation acceptable.
That means that an angle change of 1.4 degrees per meter is barely noticeable.
This also means that this method has too little effect to properly use.

Test day 3:

Goal: See if the new method works, this is rotating the scene around the testperson
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 23:
Niels:1
Didi:0

Test 23:
Niels:1
Didi:0

Test 24:
Niels:2
Didi:0

Test 25:
Niels:2
Didi:0

Test 26:
Niels:3
Didi:0

Test 27:
Niels:3
Didi:1

Test 28:
Niels:3
Didi:1

Test 29:
Niels:4
Didi:2

Test 30:
Niels:5
Didi:3.5

Test 31:
Niels:6.5
Didi:5

Test 32:
Niels:7
Didi:6

Conclusions: For this method 28 was probably the acceptable result. We were able to manipulate +/- 100 degrees in a small walking test. This means we are able to steer people towards not
Reaching vr boundries. 


Test day 4:

Goal: See if combining both methods work. Starting from the acceptance values from both tests
Test people: Niels & Didi

The scale = 0 - 10

The space we tested it in was 10x10, so it included turning of the testers.

The value is of how noticeable it was to the person:

Test 33:
Niels:2
Didi:2

Test 34:
Niels:2
Didi:2

Test 35:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 36:
Niels:3
Didi:2

Test 37:
Niels:4
Didi:3

Test 38:
Niels:5
Didi:3.5

Test 39:
Niels:5
Didi:4

Test 40:
Niels:6
Didi:4

Test 41:
Niels:6
Didi:4.5

Test 42:
Niels:6
Didi:4.5

Conclusions: Both method combined are working perfectly together, and we got +/- 180 degrees, so a full turnaround in our test.
36 seems like the most acceptable seeing acceptable user discomfort and performance.



Test day 5:

Goal: See if it feels natural and fluid to see other users moving in the same space
Test people: Niels & Didi & Patrick
Result: People saw each other, since no interpolation is applied on the network traffic users could seem a little jaggy at certain moments.
